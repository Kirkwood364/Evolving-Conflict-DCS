     - Posts that aren't allowed anywhere are ones that reinforce social structures of domination related to race, age, religion, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance or body size.\
\
     - Take heated discussions to PM's or another discord, I am shutting down that channel due to the toxicity it promotes.\
\
     - Conduct on DDCS Discord and also communities outside of DDCS is required to play on the DDCS network. Defamation/hijacking of other peoples servers & threads are grounds for BANISHMENT.\

     - Please try to be respectful and mindful of the work undertaken by others to provide you with this FREE experience/content.\
\
     - No Cheating, if you see something let a community moderator or admin know, don't start a flame war in chat, let us resolve the situation discreetly.\
\
     - Behave and Be Respectful, this community is made up of many different types/walks of people.\
\
     - Be constructive, give us suggestions on how to make something better, we want to hear why you don't like it but need the solution that goes with it.\
\
     - Try to balance the teams when you can, there is only so much we can do server wise.\
\
     - Understand that this system is constantly getting worked on and being always being balanced.\
\
     - If you want to control a combat arms vehicle, ASK for permission first from the owner! It is up to THEM to allow you access. If they say no, sling load your own or ask politely if someone will, usually someone will step up. People work VERY hard building convoys,. hours at a time!\
\
     - Anyone with a 300 ping or higher will be subject to a checks, if I deem'd too laggy you will be kick off until you fix your connection, this is to prevent people's aircraft from \"JUMPING\" out of the way of incoming missiles!\
\
THE FOLLOWING IS FORBIDDEN AND COULD RESULT IN A BAN:\
==============================================================\
     - INTENTIONALLY ramming ground units or crates with an air vehicle:\
     - We are all guilty sometimes of over-committing to a gun run.\
       Regular occurrence will be cause to remove your server access privileges.\
      Conversely ramming air units with ground units is allowed and very entertaining.\
\
     - Ramming Aircraft with other Aircraft:\
\
     - Hiding units inside buildings:\
\
     - Shooting through or out of buildings you are inside with a ground unit.\
\
     - Driving or setting way-points to a location that the vehicle cannot fit.\
          Examples:\
               * Narrow towns\
               * Deep thick forests\
     - Doing so will cause path finding issues.\
     - This will eventually kill ther server.\
\
     - Anything else that we deem to be an exploit.\
          * Examples:\
              = Disabling tree's\
              = Buildings\
              = Unsportsmanlike conduct, etc,.\
